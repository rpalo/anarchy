# Anarchy Site

Society has rules.  Maybe some of them are unwritten -- or even
unspoken!  But they are there.  And they hold everything together.
Do you know what happens when people start ignoring these rules and
doing whatever they want?  ANARCHY.  Sheer.  Utter.  Anarchy.
This site documents sightings of anarchy in the wild.
